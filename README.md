2. Dealing Cards:
   - You and the computer will each be dealt two cards.
   - You will see both of your cards and one of the computer's cards.

3. Drawing Cards:
   - You will be asked if you want to draw another card ("Y" or "N").
   - If your total exceeds 21, you lose.
   - If your total is exactly 21, you win.

4. Computer's Turn:
   - If you choose not to draw a card, it's the computer's turn.
   - The computer will draw cards until its total is 17 or higher.

5. Determine the Winner:
   - If both totals are the same, the result is a "PUSH".
   - If the computer's total exceeds 21, you win.
   - The player with the total closest to 21 wins.

6. Play Again:
   - After each game, you will be asked if you want to play again ("Y" or "N").
